# 🔒 WinScan Pro  
**Agentless Windows Vulnerability Scanner with Web UI**  

---

## 🚩 Problem  
Most security scanners require heavy agents, are expensive, or are hard to integrate.  
Organizations need a **lightweight, agentless, and easy-to-use scanner** to find vulnerabilities in Windows systems quickly.  

---

## 💡 Our Idea  
We built **WinScan Pro**, an **agentless vulnerability scanner** that:  
- Scans **Windows machines** over SMB/WinRM without installing agents.  
- Detects **open ports, weak configurations, and common vulnerabilities**.  
- Offers both **safe scans** (top 1000 ports) and **deep scans** (custom ports).  
- Provides a **simple Web UI** for easy use + a **CLI** for automation.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS  
- **Scanner Core**: `socket`, `nmap` integration, custom plugins  
- **Database/Storage**: SQLite (lightweight, local)  
- **Reports**: JSON + HTML  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. User enters **target IP / domain** in the Web UI or CLI.  
2. Chooses **Safe Scan** (fast) or **Deep Scan** (detailed).  
3. Scanner checks open ports, services, and common misconfigs.  
4. Results are shown in the dashboard + exportable reports.  

---

## 📊 Impact  
- Makes **cybersecurity accessible** for small teams & orgs.  
- **Agentless design** = no setup pain, just scan instantly.  
- Helps **prevent cyber attacks** by detecting issues early.  
- Can integrate with compliance requirements (ISO 27001, Indian CERT-In, etc).  

---

## 🎯 Future Scope  
- Add **CVE database integration** for known vulnerabilities.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for team use.  
- Cloud deployment support (scan multiple systems).
